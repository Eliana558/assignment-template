Dear Professor Gio.
Here's my instruction.(^∀＾●)
    '''
    Enter mbti and age, then randomly generate music.
    Type E MBTI: extroverted type, will generate D major and A major, generating warmer type of music; 
    Type I MBTI: introverted type, will generate C major and E major, more serene type of music.
    Younger ages will generate faster music and vice versa.
